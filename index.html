         <p>We are a smol group of smol humans chronically distracted by the great open secret that there are worlds of unending fascination tucked into every facet of the mundane. Grab onto our coattails as we organize concepts beyond the point of ludicrosity, precariously tumble down arbitrarily deep rabbitholes of obscure fun facts about things you didnâ€™t know you wanted to know about, and dispense relatable hot tips. Come with no idea what to expect and leave swollen with knowledge!

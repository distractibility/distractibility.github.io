        <p>We are a smol group of smol humans chronically distracted by the great open secret that there are worlds of unending fascination tucked into every facet of the mundane. Grab onto our coattails as we organize concepts beyond the point of ludicrosity, precariously tumble down arbitrarily deep rabbitholes of obscure fun facts about things you didn’t know you wanted to know about (carabiner classifications, topographies, writing systems, and MORE), and dispense relatable hot tips. Come with no idea what to expect and leave swollen with knowledge!

              <p>My unhealthy dedication to writing unnecessarily over-the-top event invitations was sparked in 2008 by MIT undergrad mailing list culture: a realm of strangely Lovecraftian alt-reality free food announcements, increasingly eschatological themed potlucks and parties, of resigned requests to borrow stud finders braced against the inevitable deluge of stud volunteers. Somehow, I’ve never managed to break the habit.

              <p>Eaten fresh ten minutes from the oven, the crust is crisp and golden brown and rounded from the dough’s surface tension, the crumb soft and holey. There are hints both of savory-sour from the yeast fermentation and savory-sweet from the sugars released from the carbohydrates and transformed by the Maillard reaction and by caramelization. It is simply bread.
